# circle_packing

This implementation roughly follows the implementation written up by Tyler Hobbs in his essay, ["A RANDOMIZED APPROACH TO CIRCLE PACKING"](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2016/a-randomized-approach-to-cicle-packing).

See pack_circles_demo file for example of how to use this function.
